# extreme-learning-machine
Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a supervised learning framework that simplifies the training process of artificial neural networks. This method, unlike a more traditional approach (e.g. backpropagation), is based on the least-squares estimate that is a closed and analytical solution for weights adjustment which leads to extremely fast training.
